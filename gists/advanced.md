Absolutely! Here’s a structured list of **methods, libraries, and concepts** relevant to speeding up a workflow like yours, along with a short summary of each. I’ll organize them by purpose: **asynchronous I/O**, **parallel CPU processing**, and **general efficiency tools**.

## 1️⃣ **Asynchronous I/O (for I/O-bound tasks)**

| Method / Library        | Use Case / Summary                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `asyncio`               | Python’s built-in async framework. Schedules and runs coroutines concurrently without threads. |
| `async def`             | Defines a coroutine (function that can pause/resume).                                          |
| `await`                 | Pauses execution of a coroutine until the awaited task completes.                              |
| `asyncio.run()`         | Starts the event loop and runs a coroutine.                                                    |
| `asyncio.create_task()` | Schedules a coroutine to run concurrently with others.                                         |
| `asyncio.gather()`      | Runs multiple coroutines concurrently and collects results.                                    |
| `aiofiles`              | Async file I/O library. Allows reading/writing files without blocking the event loop.          |
| `aiohttp`               | Async HTTP client/server library. Fetch multiple URLs concurrently.                            |

## 2️⃣ **Parallel CPU Processing (for CPU-bound tasks)**

| Method / Library                         | Use Case / Summary                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` | Runs CPU-heavy functions in separate processes to bypass Python’s GIL.                             |
| `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`  | Runs functions in threads; useful only if tasks are I/O-bound.                                     |
| `executor.map()`                         | Submit multiple tasks to a pool and collect results in order.                                      |
| `joblib.Parallel`                        | High-level library for running NumPy or other CPU-heavy loops in parallel; supports simple syntax. |
| `multiprocessing.Pool`                   | Classic Python module for running multiple processes in parallel.                                  |
| `mmap_mode='r'` in `np.load`             | Memory-maps large `.npz` or `.npy` files to avoid loading them entirely into RAM at once.          |

## 3️⃣ **NumPy / Data Processing Efficiency**

| Method / Concept        | Use Case / Summary                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `np.max(array, axis=…)` | Fast NumPy operation; vectorized over arrays.                                                          |
| `np.concatenate`        | Efficiently combines multiple arrays without Python loops.                                             |
| List comprehensions     | Often faster than for-loops for small operations (`[np.max(column_density[:, i]) for i in range(n)]`). |
| `pandas`                | Efficient table-like structures for reading, merging, and analyzing CSV/structured data.               |
| Pre-allocation          | Creating arrays of the final size before filling them avoids repeated resizing overhead.               |

## 4️⃣ **File Handling Tips**

| Method / Concept                | Use Case / Summary                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `with open(file) as f:`         | Safe and Pythonic way to read/write files.                                                    |
| `csv.reader`                    | Fast parsing of CSV files.                                                                    |
| Reading lines vs full file      | For async I/O: read all lines asynchronously (`await f.readlines()`) or process line-by-line. |
| Avoid repeated string splitting | Cache reusable values (like `case`, `snap`) to avoid recomputation in loops.                  |

## 5️⃣ **Hybrid Approaches**

* **Async I/O + Process Pool**:

  * Async I/O for reading `.txt` files or downloading data.
  * ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-heavy NumPy computations.
  * Maximizes throughput: your CPU isn’t blocked while waiting on I/O, and I/O isn’t blocked by heavy computation.

---

### ✅ Summary

* **Learn async I/O** (`asyncio`, `aiofiles`, `aiohttp`) for tasks that spend time waiting.
* **Learn CPU parallelism** (`ProcessPoolExecutor`, `joblib`) for tasks that crunch arrays or perform heavy computation.
* **Combine both** to handle real-world workflows like reading many large files, processing them, and merging results.
* **NumPy/pandas optimizations** ensure the actual data processing is as fast as possible.

If you want, I can make a **visual “cheat sheet” diagram** showing how these libraries/methods fit together in a workflow like yours. It’s handy for remembering which tool to use for I/O vs CPU work.

Do you want me to make that cheat sheet?
